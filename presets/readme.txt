### General changes for all presets:
QOL:
- show item level in title;
- increase tome scroll size to 60;
- compacted potion like !MP5 for mana potion where (!) is blue;
- starting Horadric cube;
- starting tome of ID;
- starting mana pots instead of health;

Drops:
- 20x increase of Uniques;
- 10x increase of sets;
- 4x more items from pack bosses, 2x more from champions; 
- almost no gold and junk (keys/bolts/rancid/etc) drops;

Density:
- Boss packs have same frequency on normal and nightmare as on hell difficulty. Basically to have items in Normal faster.


### Preset 'friendly_chaos':
Recommended characters: zeal paladin, barbarian, spear zon. With casters it will be too easy.

Item rando:
- relatively unbalanced affix level difference (up to 20 levels);
- random affixes are 50% chance to fit in the item (like have weapon-like affix on weapon). Example - having Enchance Damage not on weapon. 
- 100% original properties of item are kept; 
- unique/magic/rare items have 300% of affixes (100% original + 200% randomized);
- set items have 1000% affixes (so almost always max amount);
- magic and rare items randomized too, as well as gems;
- have 2 different incompatible sets. You will have 'Sigons Steel' and 'Sigons Steel 2' sets.

Monster rando:
- you will have up to 5 different types in one area (not 3 as in base game)
- overall monster pool is 25 monster  types. Got unlucky with Oblivion + dolls + Horadrims in Cold plains normal? reroll! (blood moor is unaffected just to start)
Note: bosses unaffected, Ancients unaffected, also fixed spawns are the same (shaman packs and catapults). 
Note: monsters in normal scaled accordingly, so you won't get oneshot by level 30 monster; still can be challenging in rare occasions.

Monster stats:
- 300% base HP and 300% base XP (similar to Players5 experience but without dmg/defence boost). If you use P8 in game it will give you something like P24 with 1350% HP.

Item power tuning:
note: item power is basically multiplying affix rolls to percent with some exceptions (for +all skills it multiply for lower value for example, so 500% power will give just 200% increase)
- All items will always have perfect (max) rolls;
- Unique items will have additional item power, raizing crazy high for high levels 
- Gems/runes will have 500% item power. (In rando you usually don't value much white socketed items)

Challenge:
- Nightmare resitance penalty -100% instead of -40%
- Hell resitance penalty -250% instead of -100%
It is very easy to overstack resistances with those settings, like have +400 all res, so don't be afraid. Also you probably get +ton of Life too.

### Preset 'magic_rando'
Recomended characters: elemental bowazon, bone necro, fire druid, fire/lightning (not nova) sorc, choose class with magic damage but not blizzard (it still OP every time)

Item rando:
- relatively balanced affix level difference (up to 8 levels);
- random affixes are 75% chance to fit in the item;
- All items will have 50% of original properties (so one time you get SoJ +1 skill, other time not);
- Uniques and sets have 150% of original property count (50% kept original, 100% extra is randomized. if item have 4 properties, 2 of 4 will be kept, 4 extra added).
- have 2 different incompatible sets
- gems, rare and magic items are unchanged

Monster rando:
- monster spawns in areas are original;
- mosnters have random resistances (magic and phys res are considered more rare);
- monsters will have same resistances in normal and nightmare as in Hell (so basically all monster is immune to something).
Keep in mind - many monsters have 'secondary' high resistance - and that is randomized too. So Zombie is immune to cold and hires to phys; it can be changed to fire+cold.

Skill rando:
- Many skills with elemental damage will do different type of damage (unfortunately I have no luck with 'explosion' skills, like fireball or explosive arrow. so for Amazon it's like only 3 skills randomized, Exploding/Freezing arrow are the same);

Monster stats:
- 300% base HP and 200% base XP. (hp like p5 and xp gain like p3).

Item power tuning:
- No extra tuning;

Challenge:
- Disabled, res are normal;

### Preset 'oh_no'
Recomended characters: some op builds like trapsin, hammerdin, blizzard sorc etc.
You have only 1 stat point on level up!

Item rando:
- relatively balanced affix level difference (up to 8 levels);
- random affixes are 80% chance to fit in the item;
- All items will have 0% of original properties;
- Uniques and sets have 100% of original property count - you have same amount of affixes but they all differ from original;
- have 2 different incompatible sets
- gems, rare and magic items are unchanged

Monster rando:
- you will have up to 5 different types in one area
- overall monster pool is 25 monster  types;
- monsters will have same resistances in normal and nightmare as in Hell and they randomized;

Skill rando:
- Disabled;

Monster stats:
- 200% base HP
- 100% base XP
- 150% base damage (so they hit like on P8)
- double normal density (for regular spawns, packs kept same as basic preset)
- monster will have 90% max resistance, so no immunities for normal monsters. 
However that means, that any monster can have all enchantements on boss; and that can give very high res overall.
Example: skelly with poison + lightning immunity become 90% lightning and 90% poison. boss having magic+cold enchantement gives cold immunity.
Practically this monster is immune to 3 damage types without extra pierce.
And yes, only way to figure high res after randomization is by attacking them.

Challenge:
- Nightmare resitance penalty -80% instead of -40%
- Hell resitance penalty -200% instead of -100%
- (!!!!) Only 1 stat point per level (and you better to put it in Strength)
- Maximum 5 hard points per skill

Requirements:
- 60% of basic strength requirement for items. (with 1 stat point is hard to equip items in first place)
